**Seasoned Full Stack Developer | 20+ Years of Experience**
Specializing in **high-performance backend systems** using **Golang** and **frontend systems** using **ReactJS + Redux** on **AWS cloud-native architectures.**


**üöÄ Key Expertise:**
* **Golang Backend Development:** Proven track record in building scalable microservices with clean architectures, dependency injection, and high concurrency.
* **ReactJS + Redux Frontend Development:** Expertise in crafting responsive, modular, and maintainable frontend applications.
* **Concurrency & Performance Optimization:** Skilled in leveraging goroutines, channels, and pprof profiling to build high-performance systems.
* **Unit & Integration Testing:** Strong advocate for test-driven development (TDD), ensuring robust code quality through detailed unit and integration tests.
* **Cloud & DevOps:** Proficient in deploying and managing applications on, Kubernetes, AWS (ECR, ECS) using Docker, Docker Compose, and CI/CD pipelines.

**üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills:**
* **Languages:** Golang, JavaScript (ES6+) 
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** ReactJS, Redux
* **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (ECR, ECS), Kubernetes, Docker, Docker Compose, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, BitBucket Pipelines)
* **Instrumentation:** pprof profiling, Prometheus, Zap, Grafana 
* **Testing:** Unit testing, Integration testing
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub workflows, BitBucket

**Design Patterns & Architectural Expertise**
* **Concurrency Pattern:**
    * Utilized in [service/user_service/user/user_service](https://github.com/syedomair/backend-microservices/blob/main/service/user_service/user/user_serivce.go){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to execute multiple database queries and gRPC calls concurrently using Go's `errgroup`.
    * Enhances the performance of the `GetAllUserStatistics` method by leveraging parallel processing.
* **Dependency Injection Pattern:**
    * Utilized in [lib/container/container.go](https://github.com/syedomair/backend-microservices/blob/main/lib/container/container.go) {:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to manage logging, database connections, and environment variables.
    * Promotes modularity and flexibility by injecting dependencies into a central container.
* **Singleton Pattern:**
    * Implemented in `lib/container/db.go` through synchronized lazy initialization (`sync.Mutex` + instance check) in `PostgresAdapter` and `MySQLAdapter`.
    * Ensures only one database connection instance is created per adapter while maintaining thread safety.
* **Adapter Pattern:**
    * Used in `lib/container/db.go` to create a unified database interface (`Db`) with concrete implementations (`PostgresAdapter` and `MySQLAdapter`).
    * Enables seamless switching between database providers without modifying client code.
* **Factory Pattern:**
    * Utilized in `lib/container/db.go` through the `NewDBConnectionAdapter` function.
    * Acts as a factory method to create instances of different database adapters based on the specified database type, encapsulating object creation logic.
* **External Configuration Pattern:**
    * Utilized in `lib/container/container.go` to manage and validate essential configuration through environment variables.
    * Ensures centralized and type-safe access to settings, promoting flexibility and ease of deployment.
* **Decorator Pattern:**
    * Utilized in `lib/response/response.go` to dynamically add behaviors to response handlers.
    * Allows setting headers or handling different response types without altering the underlying handler implementation.
* **Middleware Pattern:**
    * Utilized in `lib/router/router.go` to chain multiple handlers that add functionalities like logging, request ID management, and Prometheus metrics collection.
    * Enhances the HTTP request processing pipeline with modular and reusable components.
* **Object Pool Pattern:**
    * Implemented in `lib/container/connection.go` to manage a pool of reusable gRPC client connections.
    * Optimizes resource usage and improves performance by reducing the overhead of repeatedly creating and destroying connections.
